# Introduction to Bayesian inference of phylogeny using RevBayes

This workshop serves as an introduction to Bayesian inference of phylogeny using our new softare RevBayes. We will cover standard inference of phylogeny and basic substitution models for single and multiple loci. Additionally we explore partitioned data analysis and Bayesian model testing using Bayes factors.

This repository holds all the material for the workshop although the original sources are available from our website http://revbayes.github.io/tutorials.html. The executables can be downloaded from our website too: http://revbayes.com
